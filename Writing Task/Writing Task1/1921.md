## Essay Content

**Introduction (1 sentence)**

> The two maps compare Porth Harbour in 2000 with its current layout.

**Overview (2 sentences)**

> Overall, the harbour has been re-oriented toward tourism, with a hotel and ==a small retail strip== added alongside upgraded amenities. While core marine functions and the northern public beach remain, the southern public beach has been converted to a private one for hotel guests and the single dock has been expanded to two.

**Details — 2000 (3 sentences)**

> In 2000, facilities were largely ==utilitarian==: two car parks on the main road, one block of showers and toilets, and a marina for private yachts on the west side. Inside the ==basin== were fishing boats, a single dock serving passenger ferries, and a lifeboat station on the inner ==shore==. To the east stood a disused castle on the ==headland==, a road leading to a public beach on the southern shoreline, and another public beach on the northern shore.

**Details — Today (3 sentences)**

> Today the castle site has been redeveloped as a hotel, ==beside which== a private beach has been created; a row of cafés and shops now lines the central ==waterfront==. A second block of showers and toilets has been added near the fishing boats, and the docking area has been enlarged to two separate ==piers==. The main road remains but now includes ==a spur to== the hotel, and the car parks and original amenities have been ==retained==, with their entrances reoriented to fit the new layout.
