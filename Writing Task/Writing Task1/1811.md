## Sample

> **Introduction**
>
> The line chart shows the share of people living in urban areas in the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia between 1970 and 2020, ==with forecasts extending to 2040.==
>
> **Overview**
>
> All four countries saw ==an obvious rise== in urbanisation from 1970 to 2020, and the figures are expected to climb further by 2040. Malaysia ==led for most of the period==, while Indonesia ==expanded the fastest==, overtaking Thailand after 2000 and the Philippines around 2010 to ==secure second place==.
>
> **Malaysia & Philippines**
>
> Malaysia’s proportion of urban population grew from about 30% in 1970 to roughly 45% in 1990 and around 75% by 2020, and it ==is projected to== ==edge into== the ==low-80s== by 2040. The Philippines‘ share of urban residents rose from just over 30% in 1970 to nearly 50% in 1990, before declining to about 40% during 1990–2010. It then ==recovered to== the ==mid-40s== in 2020 and is predicted to ==climb to== around 50% in 2030 and the mid-50s by 2040.
>
> **Indonesia & Thailand**
>
> The proportion of urban population in Indonesia saw the most dramatic increase, rising from roughly 12% in 1970 to about 30% in 2000 and the mid-50s by 2020, and is forecast to ==exceed== 60% in 2040. Thailand's proportion of urban residents, in contrast, grew more slowly, from around 20% in 1970 to just under 30% in 2020. Even with growth to just close to 50% by 2040, it will ==remain== the least urbanised.
