## My Writing

> The flow graph illustrates the process of plastic bottle recycling.

> We can see that there are nine steps overall, which can be roughly divided into three stages. The first to third steps are collection and sorting, the fourth to seventh are for processing plastics, and the rest of parts are about producing new products and finally reproducing again.

> At the first stage, it requires people to put their used bottles into recycling trash bins. And then garbage trucks will take the bottles away and send them to a recycling center, where workers will categorize them. The sorted plastics will be compressed into blocks, which is the beginning of the processing stage, in order to crush them more efficiently.

> After being crushed and cleaned up, furnaces with heat will melt them into plastic pellets for shaping raw materials. When the raw materials have got collected and packaged completely, they will be delivered to various manufacturers to produce different commodities and put on the market. Eventually, the used plastic stuff will be put into recycling boxes again, entering a new reproducing circulation one more time.
