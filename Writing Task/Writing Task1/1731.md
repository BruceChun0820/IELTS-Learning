The bar chart compares how families in a certain country allocated their weekly income to different categories in 1968 and 2018.

Overall, there was a clear shift in household spending patterns over the 50-year period. While the proportions spent on food, clothing and footwear, and fuel and power declined substantially, expenditures on housing, transport, and leisure rose markedly.

In 1968, food accounted for the largest share of weekly income, at around 35%. However, by 2018 this figure had dropped to roughly 17%, representing the most significant reduction across all categories. A similar trend can be observed in spending on clothing and footwear, which fell from about 10% to just 5%, and on fuel and power, which declined from 8% to 4%. Personal goods also decreased slightly, while expenditure on household goods remained stable at about 8% in both years.

In contrast, the share of income devoted to housing almost doubled, rising from around 10% in 1968 to nearly 20% in 2018. Transport expenditure followed the same upward trajectory, climbing from approximately 6% to 14%. The most dramatic increase, however, was in leisure activities, where spending more than doubled from under 10% to about 22%, making it the largest category of household expenditure in 2018.
