### Introduction

> The diagram illustrates the cyclical process by which ethanol, a biofuel, is produced from plants and trees and subsequently used as a source of energy in transportation.

### Overview

> Overall, the production of ethanol involves several stages, beginning with plant growth and ending with its use as fuel in vehicles. The process is sustainable because carbon dioxide released during ==combustion== is reabsorbed by plants, completing the cycle.

### Details – Initial Stages

> The cycle begins as plants grow by absorbing sunlight and carbon dioxide. After harvesting, ==biomass== is pre-processed to extract cellulose, and this cellulose is processed into sugars. Microbes are then added to these sugars to initiate ==fermentation==, yielding ethanol as the main output at this point.

### Details – Later Stages

> Ethanol is subsequently distributed for use in cars, trucks and airplanes. When it is ==combusted==, carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. This gas is reabsorbed again by plants, closing the loop.
