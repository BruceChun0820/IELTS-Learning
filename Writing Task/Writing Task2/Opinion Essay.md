## Content of the essay

### Introduction

* `spending on space exploration vs. public services`  
* `space is a waste; support public benefit`

Governments in some countries spend large amounts of money on space exploration programmes. I completely agree with the idea that these are a **waste of money**, and that the funds should be **allocated to public services**.

------

### Paragraph 2

There are several reasons why **space programmes should be stopped**. Firstly, they are **extremely expensive**: training scientists and building facilities and equipment require huge investment. Secondly, they **do not benefit ordinary people** in daily life — these are often just **vanity projects** used by politicians to show power. Finally, space travel is **risky and dangerous**; a single mistake can cost lives. The **Challenger space shuttle disaster** showed us how dangerous such missions can be. In my view, these programmes are not worth the risk.

------

### Paragraph 3

I believe that money spent on space projects should be **redirected to public services**. It is **much cheaper** to train teachers, doctors, or police than astronauts or engineers. Public service workers also have a **positive impact on everyone** in society. For example, we all rely on **schools, hospitals, roads**, and **police protection**. If governments used this money better, **many thousands of people could be lifted out of poverty** and live better lives.

------

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I think governments should **prioritize funding for public services** because they benefit everyone. It is **wrong to waste money** on space exploration when the money could be used to **improve people’s everyday lives**.
