## Essay Question

*In the future all cars, buses and trucks will be driverless. The only people traveling inside these vehicles will be passengers.*

*Do you think the advantages of driverless vehicles outweigh the disadvantages?*

## My writing

> It is a well-known view that all vehicles will be driverless and run automatically without **the** control of humans. While such smart products involve a lot of benefits, I still do not believe their advantages outweigh **the** disadvantages completely.

> There are a few ~~reason~~ **reasons** why driverless cars are widely welcomed. Firstly, people traveling in the driverless cars would feel ~~convenient and~~ comfortable and **find it convenient** <!-- convenient不能形容人，只能形容物 -->, since they could just enjoy their travel without tiredness caused by focusing and concentrating on driving, especially on long-distance journeys. Secondly, the modern ~~automatical~~**automatic** driving system involves sophisticated artificial intelligence technology, which can significantly decrease the possibility of traffic accidents. Finally, the prosperity of **the** smart vehicle industry can definitely promote and encourage technological development.

> While the advantages of driverless vehicles ~~show lots of effects~~ have postitive impacts, their disadvantages cannot be ignored. Although computer programs are powerful, they can still possibly break down, which is absolutely deadly for passengers. With such a risk, we are not able to sit in the car without any worry. For example, the Challenger shuttle accident, which was caused by a computer error, makes its safety uncertain. I therefore cannot hold the belief that vehicles entirely controlled by computers are reliable.

> In conclusion, the driverless vehicle can actually bring us convenience and benefits, but due to its potential danger, I cannot state its advantages have outweighed the disadvantages.

> It is widely predicted that all vehicles in the future will be autonomous, eliminating the need for human drivers entirely. While driverless technology certainly brings convenience and innovation, I believe its ==drawbacks== currently outweigh its potential benefits.

> There are several reasons why self-driving cars ==are embraced by== many. Firstly, passengers can enjoy a more relaxed and comfortable journey, without the ==fatigue== and concentration required for long-distance driving. Secondly, ==autonomous== vehicles ==rely on== ==advanced artificial intelligence and sensor systems==, which are designed to reduce human errors and thus minimize the risk of traffic accidents. Finally, the development of driverless technology stimulates innovation and investment in the transportation and tech industries, potentially driving economic growth.

> However, the disadvantages of driverless vehicles cannot be ==overlooked==. ==Despite technological advancements==, computer systems are not ==infallible==. A single software ==malfunction== or sensor failure could result in ==catastrophic== accidents, ==raising serious concerns about== safety. For instance, there have been reports of autonomous vehicle trials ending in fatal crashes due to unexpected system errors. Moreover, without human ==oversight==, it becomes difficult to respond to unpredictable real-world situations, such as roadblocks, extreme weather, or ==moral dilemmas==. Trusting artificial intelligence with full control over human lives is a step that requires much more ==rigorous== testing and ==ethical== consideration.

> In conclusion, while driverless vehicles may offer substantial convenience and efficiency, the risks ==associated with== total automation in transportation remain significant. Therefore, I do not believe that their advantages currently outweigh the disadvantages.
