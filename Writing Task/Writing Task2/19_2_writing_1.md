### **Introduction**

The two maps compare the layout of Porth Harbour in 2000 with its current form, illustrating a range of structural and functional developments that have taken place over time.

### **Overview**

Overall, the harbour has undergone substantial transformation, with former facilities such as the disused castle and part of the public beach being replaced by modern infrastructure. Additions like a hotel, cafés and shops indicate a shift towards commercialisation and tourism. While the main public beach near the ferry terminal remains unchanged, the dock area has expanded noticeably.

### **Details – Description of 2000**

In 2000, the harbour was relatively simple in structure. On the western side, there were two car parks, a single block of showers and toilets, and a private marina for yachts. To the east, a dock served passenger ferries near a public beach, while fishing boats and a lifeboat were located further south along the coast. A notable feature was the disused castle situated on the southeastern headland, next to which was another stretch of public beach extending along the southern shoreline.

### **Details – Description of Today**

Today, several major developments are evident. The castle has been removed and replaced with a hotel, and the adjacent public beach has been transformed into a private beach for hotel guests. A row of cafés and shops has been added next to the marina, and a second block of showers and toilets has been installed beside the fishing boats. Additionally, the dock area has been expanded, now featuring two separate docking points along the harbour. New roads have also been constructed to provide access to the hotel, while the main road from 2000, which links to two car parks as well as the lifeboat station and hotel, continues to serve the harbour.
