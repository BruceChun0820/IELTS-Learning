## Essay Question

**Nowadays, people spend a great deal of time sitting, leading to health problems. Why does this happen? What are the best ways to encourage people to sit less?**

## Sample

> In today's society, ==sedentary== behavior has become ==a defining feature== of daily life. From long office hours to leisure ==dominated by== screens, people often sit for ==extended periods==. I believe this trend ==arises from== ==modern work patterns==, == == it can be addressed through practical ==interventions==.

> One major reason is that the ==prevalence== of sitting is strongly ==tied to== the structure of comtemporary work. Many jobs require hours at a desk, while digital devices dominate recreation. For example, an employee may spend the day in meetings and data analysis, then return home to watch television or ==scroll on== a phone. Car commuting adds even more sitting time, ==leaving little space for== natural movement. Over time, such habits contribute to ==weight gain and higher stress==, often without people realizing how much time they remain inactive.

> One effective way to address this problem is for workplaces to integrate movement into the daily routine. Standing desks, walking meetings, or even scheduled stretch breaks can make physical activity a natural part of work rather than an ==afterthought==. For instance, companies that encourage employees to hold short discussions while walking across offices often result in ==cutting down== on sitting time. These interventions demonstrate that small ==adjustments== in work culture can create healthier habits without sacrificing productivity.

> Another ==promising== approach is to promote public health campaigns that encourage active transport and ==accessible recreation==. Not all solutions can rely on workplaces, as individual lifestyle choices also matter. For example, cities that expand bike lanes or create pedestrian-friendly parks provide residents with opportunities to replace sitting with light exercise in their daily routines.

> In conclusion, ==excessive== sitting ==is rooted in== the ==nature of modern work and lifestyles==, yet it is not ==irreversible==. By reshaping ==workplace practices== and fostering more active lifestyles through ==publc initiatives==, societies can counter this trend and build ==healthier patterns== for the future.
