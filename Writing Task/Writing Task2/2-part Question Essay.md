## Content of the essay

### Introduction

* `decisions about new stories`
* `variety of factors, yes too much bad news`

​	It is true that editors have to make difficult decisions about which news stories they broadcast or publish, and their choices are no doubt influenced by a variety of factors. In my opinion, we ==are exposed to== too much bad news, and I would ==welcome a greater emphasis== on good news.

### Paragraph 2

​	Editors face a range of considerations when deciding what news stories to focus on. Firstly, I imagine that they have to consider whether ==viewers== or readers will be interested enough to ==choose their television channel or their newspaper over competing providers==. Secondly, news editors have a responsibility to inform the public about important events and issues, and they should therefore prioritize stories that are in the public interest. Finally, editors ==are probably under some pressure== from the owners who employ them. For example, a newspaper owner might have ==particular political views== that he or she wants to ==promote==.

### Paragrph 3

​	It seems to me that people do become accustomed to negative news. We ==are exposed on a daily basis to== stories about war, crime, natural disasters and ==tragic human suffering== ==around the world==. I believe that such repeated exposure ==gradually desensitizes== people, and we become mre ==cynical== about the world and more ==skeptical== that we can do anything to change it. I would prefer to see more positive news stories, such as reports of the work of medical staff after a natural disaster, or the kindness of volunteers who help in their communities. This kind of news might inspire us all to lead better lives.

### Conclusion

​	In conclusion, it must be extremely difficult for editors to choose which news stories to present, but I would like to see ==a more positive approach== to this vital public service.
