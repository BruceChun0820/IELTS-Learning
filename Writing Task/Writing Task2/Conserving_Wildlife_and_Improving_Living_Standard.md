# Essay Question

*Some people think that improving people’s standard of living is always more important than protecting wild birds and animals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

## Content of Essay

> ==In many societies==, economic development is viewed as the primary goal, often ==justified as== a means to raise living standards. However, some argue that such progress should ==take precedence over== conserving wildlife. I strongly disagree with this view, as environmental protection is not only ==compatible with== human ==welfare==, but also essential to ==sustaining== it.
>
> To begin with, protecting wild animals ==plays a vital role in== maintaining ==ecological balance==, which directly influences human well-being. Healthy ecosystems ==regulate climate==, ==purify water==, ==pollinate crops==, and ==prevent the spread of disease==. For example, the ==decline of== certain bird species has ==been linked to== increased pest populations, which ==in turn== affects agriculture and food security. If ==environmental degradation== continues ==unchecked==, any ==temporary gains in living standards may be offset by long-term losses in health and economic stability==.
>
> Moreover, the ==preservation== of wildlife can generate significant economic benefits through ==sustainable tourism and biodiversity-based industries==. Countries like Costa Rica and Kenya have demonstrated that protecting natural habitats can attract millions of tourists, create jobs, and generate income without ==depleting== natural resources. These ==models== show that investing in ==conservation== is ==not a luxury but a strategic== decision that can support both people and nature.
>
> ==Admittedly==, ==there are cases where== ==immediate improvements== to housing, healthcare, or infrastructure are urgently needed, especially in low-income areas. However, this does not require ignoring wildlife conservation. On the contrary, ==integrating== environmental concerns into development planning can produce more ==resilient== outcomes. For instance, constructing flood-resistant housing near protected wetlands not only benefits human residents but also preserves essential bird habitats. ==In this sense, prioritizing one goal should not mean sacrificing the other.==
>
> To conclude, improving living standards and protecting wildlife should not be viewed as ==competing goals==. Long-term human ==prosperity== depends on a ==healthy planet==, and policies that integrate both social and environmental needs are more likely to yield sustainable and ==equitable== outcomes.
