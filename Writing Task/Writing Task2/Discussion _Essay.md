## Content of the essay

### Introduction

* `competition or co-operation?`

* `benefits of both, co-operation more important`

> ​	People have different views about whether children should be taught to be competitive or co-operative. While ==a spirit of competition== can sometimes be useful in life, I believe that the ability to co-operate is more important.
>

### Paragraph 2

`Why encourage competition?`

> ​	On the one hand, competition can be ==a great source of motivation== for children. When teachers use games or prizes to ==introduce an element of competitiveness into== lessons, it can encourage children to work harder to ==outdo== the other ==pupils== in the class. This kind of healthy ==rivalry== may help to build children's self confidence, while pushing them to work independently and progress more quickly. When these children leave school, their confidence and ==determination== will help them in competitive situations such as job interviews. It can therefore be argued that competition should be encouraged in order to prepare children for adult life.
>

### Paragraph 3

`Why teach co-operation?`

> ​	On the other hand, it is ==perhaps== even more important to prepare children for the many aspects of adult life that require co-operation. In the workplace, adults are expected to **work** in teams, **follow** instructions given by their superiors, or **supervise** and **support** the more junior members of staff. Team ==collaboration== skills are much more useful than ==a competitive determination to win==. This is the attitude that I believe schools should ==foster== in young people. Instead of promoting the idea that ==people are either winners or losers==, teachers could show children that they gain more from working together.
>

### Conclusion

`accept both views, co-operation better` 

> ​	In conclusion, I can understand why people might want to encourage competitiveness in children, but it seems to me that a co-operative attitude is much more ==desirable== in adult life.
>
