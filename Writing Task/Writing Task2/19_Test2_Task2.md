## Essay Question

*The **working week should be shorter** and **workers** should have a **longer weekend**.* 

*Do you agree or disagree?*

## My Writing

> It is always argued that we should decrease working days and provide more time to rest. I completely agree with this view that the weekend should be extended.

> There are several reasons why the working week should be reduced. Firstly, workers ~~do~~ need more time ~~for~~ **to** relaxing since they are under a variety of stress from daily expenditure, children’s education and superiors, etc. Secondly, less working time can absolutely improve mental health and productivity of overall society. For example, the Japanese government has undertaken to promote a four-day working and three-day weekend policy, which is in order to lower the rate of suicide caused by heavy pressure.

> Finally, as science and technology have been extremely advanced, computers and machines can carry out a lot of tasks for people. Therefore, workers do not need to work ~~so long as before~~. **as long as before / for such long hours**

> It is true that providing more time for rest is of benefit to people and society. All of the staff will have more time to accompany their family and friends, which can also enhance leisure and entertainment industries. While people spend less time working, they could make themselves more ~~active~~**energetic / engaged** and productive, which would ~~bring employers and enterprises better quality of yield~~.**achieve higher productivity and performance** Besides, what is most important is that the well-being of the whole society will be significantly improved through such a great measure.

> In conclusion, I think we should take more rest time because it benefits everyone and our whole society.

## A Band9 Sample Essay

> It is widely argued that the modern ==workforce== ==deserves a shorter working week==.  I completely agree that reducing the number of workdays and extending the weekend will ==lead to greater benefits for both individuals and society==.

> Firstly, having a longer weekend significantly improves employees’ physical and mental well-being. Workers today are frequently overwhelmed by ==demanding schedules==, ==tight deadlines==, ==and increasing workplace expectations==. Secondly, with more free time, individuals can rest, engage in hobbies, and ==strengthen bonds with family and friends==, ==all of which contribute to emotional balance and personal fulfillment==. Finally, this improved work-life balance helps ==prevent burnout==, ==reduces absenteeism==, and ==minimizes long-term health problems==. For example, in countries like Japan, where overwork has long been a national issue, ==trials== of a four-day workweek have led to notable improvements in employee happiness, engagement, and overall efficiency. In this way, allowing more time for recovery not only enhances people’s quality of life but also benefits the workforce ==as a whole==.

> A shorter working week can also increase productivity and job satisfaction. When employees are well-rested and mentally ==refreshed==, they are more focused, innovative, and motivated to complete their tasks effectively. ==For instance==, ==a major study conducted== in Iceland tested a shorter workweek ==across various industries== and found that productivity was maintained or even improved in nearly all cases. This evidence strongly suggests that reducing hours ==does not compromise results but rather enhances them==. In fact, fewer working days can encourage better planning, smarter time use, and higher morale across the workforce.

> In conclusion, reducing the number of working days and offering a longer weekend is a wise and ==forward-looking== decision. It benefits not only individual workers but also the economy and the wider society.
