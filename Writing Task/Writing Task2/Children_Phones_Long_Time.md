## Essay Question

*Some children spend hours every day on their smartphones.**Why is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?*

## Essay Sample

> In recent years, it has become increasingly common for children to spend long hours on their smartphones. This ==phenomenon== has ==sparked widespread concern== about its causes and consequences. While mobile devices ==undoubtedly== bring certain benefits, I believe that the disadvantages for children’s development far outweigh the positives.
>
> To begin with, the main reason children are often absorbed in their phones is the rapid advancement of technology and the ==digitalization== of daily life. With countless apps, online games, and social media platforms designed to capture attention, young users—who often lack self-control—find it difficult to resist. In addition, the fast-paced lifestyle of modern society means that many parents devote the majority of their time to ==demanding careers==. As a result, they have limited opportunities to supervise or accompany their children, which ==indirectly== encourages ==youngsters== to spend excessive time on screens.
>
> Moreover, ==prolonged== use of smartphones can have ==severe== consequences for both physical and mental health. Excessive screen time is strongly ==associated with== deteriorating eyesight, ==which explains== why many children require glasses at an unusually young age. Equally concerning is the emotional impact of ==immersing in== a virtual world. Children who prioritize digital entertainment over real-life interaction may lose interest in outdoor activities, sports, and even family bonding. Over time, this can result in social ==isolation== and ==hinder== the development of essential ==interpersonal skills==.
>
> Admittedly, smartphones can also serve as useful educational tools and provide opportunities for children to access information, improve digital literacy, and stay connected with ==peers==. However, these advantages are ==overshadowed== by the risks of addiction, declining academic performance, and unhealthy lifestyles when usage is not ==monitored==.
>
> In conclusion, the growing trend of children spending hours on their smartphones is mainly driven by technological distractions and ==insufficient== parental guidance. Although mobile devices may offer certain learning benefits, I ==am convinced== that the negative impacts on health, education, and social development make this a harmful trend that society should address urgently.
