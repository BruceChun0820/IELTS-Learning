# Speaking Script Part 1

## Snacks

* When do you usuallly eat snacks now？

I do usually eat snacks whenever ==I feel like it==. For example, when I’m feeling a bit down or upset, I'd like to have something sweet to cheer myself up. Also, in the afternoon—especially ==after a short nap==—I often ==grab a sweet snack== to help me focus better when I start working. I’m not exactly sure why, but it just works for me.

* Do you think it's healthy for you to eat snacks?

I believe that snacks might not be physically healthy, since they tend to be greasy or oily. Some of them also contain a lot of sugar, which could even ==accelerate== aging to some extent. However, I have to say that sweet snacks can actually help ==improve your mood==. They stimulate the body to generate ==dopamine==, which makes you feel happy. So while they may not be great for your physical health, I would say they might be heathy for you ==mentally==. So, in moderation, I think snacks can be part of a balanced lifestyle.
