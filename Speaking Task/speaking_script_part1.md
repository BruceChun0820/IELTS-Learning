# Speaking Script Part 1

## Snacks

* **When do you usuallly eat snacks now？**

I do usually eat snacks whenever ==I feel like it==. For example, when I’m feeling a bit down or upset, I'd like to have something sweet to cheer myself up. Also, in the afternoon—especially ==after a short nap==—I often ==grab a sweet snack== to help me focus better when I start working. I’m not exactly sure why, but it just works for me.

* **Do you think it's healthy for you to eat snacks?**

I believe that snacks might not be physically healthy, since they tend to be greasy or oily. Some of them also contain a lot of sugar, which could even ==accelerate== aging to some extent. However, I have to say that sweet snacks can actually help ==improve your mood==. They stimulate the body to generate ==dopamine==, which makes you feel happy. So while they may not be great for your physical health, I would say they might be heathy for you ==mentally==. So, in moderation, I think snacks can be part of a balanced lifestyle.

* **Did you often eat snacks when you were young?**

When I was young, I wasn't really allowed to do so. Bcause my parents believed that having too much snacks is not good or healthy for my body and I guess that's also the reason why now I ==crave== sugar a lot. Maybe sometimes can be too ==obsessed== with some snacks. But I do appreciate that my parents stopped me from eating too much when I was young. So it allowed me to actually grow healthily without getting sick a lot.

* **What snacks do you like to eat?**

My favorite snack would be the ice cream. I just like it is very creamy and milky texture. And it is also cold which is perfect for the hot summer days. Besides probably ==gummy bear== (小熊软糖). I really like the texture of it like it is very ==chewy== and probably sometimes ==crisps==. I don't crave that a lot but when I want to watch a movie I think crisps would be the perfect match.

## Holidays

* **Where did you go for your last holiday?**

> I went to Guizhou province last summer, specifically to visit the Huangguoshu Waterfall and the city of Guiyang. It was a memorable experience because the natural scenery was absolutely ==magnificent==, and the local food was delicious. I really enjoyed the relaxed pace of life there.

* **Do you like holidays and why?**

> Yes, I love holidays because they give me a chance to ==unwind== and escape from my daily routine. It’s a great time to spend with family and friends. Holidays also help me ==recharge== my energy and come back to work or study with a fresh mind.

* **Which public holiday do you like best?**

> I would say the Spring Festival is my favorite. It’s the most important traditional holiday in China, and I get to ==reunite== with my family, enjoy big meals. I also enjoy the festive ==atmosphere== and take part in traditional activities like setting off fireworks, playing mahjong with my family and friends, and just spending quality time together. 

* **What do you usually do on holidays?**

> It depends on the length of the holiday. If it’s just a short break, I usually stay at home, watch movies, or hang out with friends. But for longer holidays, I prefer travelling to a new place, especially somewhere with nature or ==historical== sites.

* **Do you like to spend your day at home?**

> Yes, sometimes I do. Especially when I feel tired or the weather is bad, staying at home feels really ==cozy==. I can sleep in, read a book, or ==binge-watch== a series. But after a while, I still want to go out and do something more active.

* **Do you prefer a leisurely or a busy holiday?**

> I prefer a leisurely holiday. I don’t enjoy rushing from one place to another. Instead, I’d rather take my time, explore one or two attractions in depth, and truly relax. ==That way==, I can enjoy the experience more fully.

* **Would you prefer an exciting holiday or a peaceful holiday?**

> It depends on my mood, but most of the time I’d choose a peaceful holiday. I like being surrounded by nature, maybe near the mountains or a quiet beach. That kind of environment helps me relax and ==reflect==, which I think is the true value of a holiday.
