## Text Message

### How often do you send text messages? 

I send text messages pretty often because I just enjoy being able to talk to my friends all the time. I can't live without my friends, so I just text them all the time and  ramble about anything in my life.

### Is sending messages popular in your country?

Yeah, I think so. It's super popular in China. Well, actually it's sometimes too popular because when you are on public transport like subway, you may see people glue to their screen and sending messages like crazy.
