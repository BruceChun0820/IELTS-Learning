## Uses of “Rather”

* ***“Rather”* is an adverb with several core meanings and usages:**

* **To Some Extent / Quite / Fairly**

  * Used to express a moderate degree of something (softer than “very”).

  * Examples

    * It's rather cold today.

    * He is rather shy.

    * I rather like this song

  * $\bigstar$ In spoken English, it is common to use "rather + like/love/enjoy"

* **Slightly / Somewhat (Often Negative)**
  * Examples
    * His tone was rather rude.
    * This room is rather small.
* **Instead / On the Contrary**
  * Structure: not A, but rather B
  * Examples
    * He is not stupid, but rather inexperienced.
    * It's not a question of cost, but rather of attitude.
* **Would Prefer/ Would Sooner**
  * Structure: would rather + base verb+than+base verb **OR** would rather + A or B 
  * Examples
    * I'd rather stay at home than go out.
    * Would you rather have coffee or tea?
    * He would rather not talk about it.
  * **Compare with "Prefer"**
    * "Prefer" is a verb, so its sentence structure is different from "would rather"
    * Structure 
      * "Prefer (doing) A to (doing) B" means somebody likes (doing) A more than (doing) B
      * "Prefer to do A rather than do B" means somebody likes (doing) A more than (doing) B
* **More Precisely / More Accurately Speaking**
  * Examples
    * She's my colleague, or rather, my mentor.
    * We're friends, or rather, close friends.
  * $\bigstar$ "or rather" is a natural phrase in both spoken and written English
* **Rather than **
  * Meaning "instead of", used to show preference, contrast, or replacement.
  * Structures
    * Rather than do A, somebody does B
    * Somebody does B rather than do A
    * A rather than B (noun/adj)
  * Examples
    * She chose to walk rather than wait.
    * They hired him for his skills rather than his experience.
    * He's practical rather than idealistic.
  * **Compare with "as opposed to"**
    * Meaning
      * "as opposed to" emphasizes contrast
      * "rather than" emphasizes preference/choice
    * Structure
      * as opposed to doing/noun
      * "to" is a preposition here
    * Examples
      * We prefer quality as opposed to quantity.
      * People hold different opinions about the effectiveness of group study as opposed to working alone.

## Preposition + Relative Clause

* **What is it?**

  * This structure appears when the ==antecedent== (the noun being modified) is ==the object of a preposition== in the relative clause.

  * Rather than place the preposition at the end (informal), we move it ==before "which" or "whom"== to form a more formal sentence.

* **Structure**

  Antecedent + preposition + which/whom + subject + verb...

* **Examples**

  | Original Sentences           | Preposition + Relative Clause      |
  | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
  | I stayed at the hotel.       | The hotel at which I stayed.       |
  | I spoke to the woman.        | The woman to whom I spoke.         |
  | I applied to the university. | The university to which I applied. |

* **Informal vs. Formal Comparison**

  | Formal (written English)        | Informal / Spoken English       |
  | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
  | The person to whom I spoke...   | The person who I spoke to...    |
  | The house in which I lived....  | The house that I lived in...    |
  | The job for which he applied... | The job which he applied for... |
